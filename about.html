                <div class="CH1">What is onedge.games? <hr></div>
                <div class="CH2">I created this website to host the games I (re)program. Designing AND coding games in Unity was too much for me to learn at once, so I
                decided to rereate classic games. Seeing as I've always wanted my own web domain, this seemed like my best opportunity to get started. I already had a background
                in HTML/CSS/Javascript so the only real challenge was a bunch of technical domain hosting stuff. This website is just a personal project
                that I am using for practice/fun.</div>
                <div class="CH1"><hr>Who are you? <hr></div>
                <div class="CH2">I'm a 1st year student at <Span id="osu">THE Ohio State University</Span>. I plan on majoring in Computer Information and Sciences.
                I've been interested in computers since I got my first one in 8th grade. What really got me into programming was Minecraft command blocks
                and mapping. After I became interested I started taking classes in my high school. Ever since then, I'm certain it's what
                I want to do, ideally game development. Some fun facts are that I played volleyball in high school, I'm 6'6", and I've here in central Ohio
                my entire life. Not that fun, I guess.</div>
                <div class="CH1"><hr>I'm interested in programming, where do I start?<hr></div>
                <div class="CH2">Well, that's a loaded question that depends on a lot of factors, and I'm probably not the most qualified advisor for
                this info. That being said, I can tell you what I did to start, and what I would have done differently were I to do it again. The single
                most useful piece of advice I can give you is to <strong>PRACTICE WHAT YOU ARE THE WORST AT!</strong> Seriously, I spent the first 6 months
                of my programming career using a singular class in Java, only because that's what I was comfortable with. It resulted in complicated headaches
                of projects, and a complete lack of understanding of class relations and dependencies. Practice the things you're not comfortable with(which also applies
                to many other things in life). Other than that, I would suggest focusing on Pseudocoding (writing code down without worry of syntax/compile errors)
                firstly, then get used to the actual programming language and worry about syntax. Have an objective, start small, and stop at nothing to achieve said objective.
